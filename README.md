When a player is killed by a player, they drop a head.

This head can be used by another player to make them invisible to the head's owner.

Players can also run /decorate to make the heads purely decorative.

Invisibility lasts for 1 minute (default) or until the head's owner is hit by the player. Heads have a 20-second cooldown by default.

Disguise heads allow a player to disguise as another player for a period of time set in the config. Its crafting recipe can be adjusted to use either amethyst shards or echo shards. Messages to a player will be redirected to a player disguised as them. (1.1+)

Death Bonds transfer half of the damage done to one player to another. This effect lasts until either player goes below 2 hearts (default) or 30 minutes (default) after it was activated. **(Unreleased, 1.3 content)**

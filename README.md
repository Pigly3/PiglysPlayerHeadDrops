<a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/piglys-player-head-drops"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=158000&label=downloads&prefix=+%20&query=downloads&url=https://api.modrinth.com/v2/project/hvwKeVnz&logo=modrinth" alt="Modrinth Downloads"></a>

When a player is killed by a player, they drop a head.

This head can be used by another player to make them invisible to the head's owner.

Players can also run /decorate to make the heads purely decorative.

Invisibility lasts for 1 minute (default) or until the head's owner is hit by the player. Heads have a 20-second cooldown by default.

## Other Heads

# Pigly's Player Head Drops
When a player is killed by a player, they drop a head. 

This head can be used by another player to make them invisible to the head's owner.

Players can also run /decorate to make the heads purely decorative.

Invisibility lasts for 1 minute or until the head's owner is hit by the player. 

Heads have a 20-second cooldown.
